Though we are saddened that we cannot be together this year for these two amazing events at the lake we are hopeful and look forward to bringing them back better than ever in 2021.\n\n_SLWC Annual Meeting_ - The SLWC Annual Meeting which is traditionally help on the May long weekend has been postponed. When we are able to reschedule the date we will let you know.\n\n_Sunday Services_ - Until further notice all Sunday services at SLWC are cancelled.\n\n### April 22, 2020 Update\n\nThe Camp Board is scheduled to meet every two weeks during the present pandemic. At our _April 18, 2020_, the following steps were affirmed.\n\n_Summer Camps_ - As we donâ€™t know yet what the full impact that COVID-19 might have on our summer camps, at present we have not made any changes to our summer camping programs hoping that we can run our full slate of summer camps. Nevertheless, given the uncertainty, we have let our summer staff know that should they seek and find alternative employment, we would release them from their commitment to work at the camp.\n\n_Rentals_ - We continue to plan to be able to host our summer rental guests. Nevertheless, given the uncertainty, we have let our rental groups know that we would require only two weeks notice should they decide to cancel their booking.\n\n_Camp water system_ - As you know, we typically have our camp water system up and running by the May long weekend (at the latest). Given the current context, while our water system may be operational, we have not yet determined when we might be able to distribute water to the various areas of our camp (we have the ability to turn on or off different sections of the camp).\n\n* _Trailer sites_ - As we understand the regulation, our trailer sites must remain closed unless the trailer is the principal residence of the individual. For that reason, under the current regulations we cannot distribute water to our trailer sites.\n* _Cottage Sites_ - As you know, the **Premier** of Ontario, Doug Ford has requested that cottage owners not travel to their cottages. While we understand that this request made by the Premier is not governed by regulation, we believe it is important to respect this request. For that reason, we will be looking for direction from the various levels of Government before we plan to distribute water to our cottage owners.\n\n_Next update_ - Our camp Board meets next on _May 1, 2020_. Look for an update on our website shortly after that date.","carousel_images":["/slwc-gridsome/uploads/4.jpg","/slwc-gridsome/uploads/5.jpg","/slwc-gridsome/uploads/3.jpg"]}},"context":{}}
